# D3-Challenge

About the project:
It was required to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The data set included with the project is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

For this activity it was required to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques the following was accomplished.
* Creation of  a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
* Coding this graphic in the app.js file, extracting the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 
* Scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the bottom of this section.
