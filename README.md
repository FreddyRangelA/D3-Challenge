# D3-Challenge

For this activity it was required to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using the D3 techniques the following was accomplished.
* Creation of  a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
* Coding this graphic in the app.js file, extracting the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 
* Scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the bottom of this section.
